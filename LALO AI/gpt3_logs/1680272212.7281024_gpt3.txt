Some of the local specialties you should definitely try include ugali, a maize-based dish that is a staple of Kenyan cuisine; sukuma wiki, a dish made with greens and tomatoes; and nyama choma, a grilled meat dish. There are also plenty of delicious seafood dishes, such as grilled fish, prawns, and calamari. Have you ever tried any of these dishes before?
