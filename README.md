# 2023-ML-Projects
So it's just January 2023 and I have been working on two projects so far, I started with the Basket Analysis project, all the way to the Djikistra's algorithm and now I'm working on analyzing my financial statement and preparing an excel dashboard. I'll be available for commits anytime
